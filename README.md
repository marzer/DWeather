# DWeather
 
In 2003, when I was 16 years old, I made a "dynamic weather" toolkit for UT2004 mappers to add all sorts of insane things to their worlds. Day/night cycles, lighting strikes, tornados, et cetera.

It was the very first thing I ever coded, and was the whole reason I learned to code to begin with. I owe my career to UT2004 ‚ù§&#xFE0F;.

This repository is a preservation of that work. Shout out to [@Crusha_K](https://twitter.com/Crusha_K) for doing the legwork to resurrect it!
